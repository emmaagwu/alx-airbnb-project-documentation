# 📝 User Stories – Airbnb Clone Backend

This directory contains detailed user stories derived from the use case diagram and feature specification.

User stories describe how users interact with the system from their point of view. They help guide the design, implementation, and testing of the backend features.

## 📄 Contents

- `user-stories.md` – A markdown document that outlines:
  - 👤 Guest User Stories (e.g., search and book properties)
  - 🏡 Host User Stories (e.g., create/edit listings)
  - 🛡 Admin User Stories (e.g., moderate content, view stats)

Each story follows this format:

> **As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action], so that I can [achieve a goal].**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

User stories serve as:
- A communication tool between stakeholders and developers
- A starting point for backend endpoint design
- A reference for writing unit and integration tests
- A basis for defining acceptance criteria in agile workflows

---

## 📌 Example

> **As a guest, I want to search for properties by location and price, so that I can find the best deal for my stay.**

## 🛠 Notes

These stories can later be:
- Expanded into **task cards** (e.g., for Trello, GitHub Projects, or JIRA)
- Converted to **API specs**
- Used to write **behavior-driven test cases** (e.g., with Gherkin)
