# 🏡 Airbnb Clone – Project Documentation

This repository contains the **comprehensive planning, analysis, and design documentation** for the **backend system of an Airbnb Clone**.

It covers the essential software engineering steps that precede development, including identifying system features, designing architecture diagrams, drafting user stories, and writing technical specifications.

## 📚 Repository Structure

| Directory | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [`features-and-functionalities/`](./features-and-functionalities) | High-level summary of all backend features (e.g., user auth, listings, bookings, payments) presented in a visual diagram. |
| [`use-case-diagram/`](./use-case-diagram) | Use case diagram illustrating how different user types (guests, hosts, admins) interact with the system. |
| [`user-stories/`](./user-stories) | Written user stories based on the use case diagram, outlining system behavior from the user’s perspective. |
| [`data-flow-diagram/`](./data-flow-diagram) | Data Flow Diagram (DFD) showing how data moves through the backend system during core operations. |
| [`flowcharts/`](./flowcharts) | Flowcharts that map out the steps and logic behind specific system processes (e.g., user registration, booking). |
| [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md) | Detailed technical and functional requirements for major backend features like user authentication, property management, and booking system. |

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze and document the backend requirements of a platform like Airbnb
- Prepare a robust system plan before coding
- Practice applying **software engineering best practices** such as:
  - Visual modeling (ERD, use cases, flowcharts)
  - Requirement gathering
  - User-centered design

---

## 🧠 What This Enables

With this documentation, developers can:
- Understand **what to build**, **why**, and **for whom**
- Use the visual assets as a reference during implementation
- Ensure all backend operations are covered by real-world use cases and user needs

## 🛠 Tools Used

- [Draw.io (diagrams.net)](https://app.diagrams.net) – for all diagrams
- Markdown – for writing stories and specs
- Git/GitHub – for version control and collaboration
